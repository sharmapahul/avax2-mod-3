# MyToken

MyToken is an ERC20 token with burnable and mintable capabilities. It is built using OpenZeppelin contracts to ensure security and reliability.

## Features

- **ERC20**: Standard ERC20 token functionality.
- **Burnable**: Tokens can be burned to reduce the total supply.
- **Mintable**: Only the owner can mint new tokens.
- **Ownable**: Ownership of the contract is managed to restrict certain functionalities to the contract owner.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project locally for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- Truffle or Hardhat (for development and testing)
- Solidity ^0.8.0

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MyToken.git
   cd MyToken
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Deployment

You can deploy the contract using Truffle or Hardhat. Below is an example using Truffle:

1. **Compile the contracts:**

   ```sh
   truffle compile
   ```

2. **Deploy the contracts:**

   ```sh
   truffle migrate
   ```

### Usage

Below are the main functionalities provided by the `MyToken` contract.

#### Mint Tokens

Only the owner can mint new tokens.

```solidity
function mint(uint256 amount) public onlyOwner
```

#### Burn Tokens

Any token holder can burn their tokens to reduce the total supply.

```solidity
function anyoneBurn(uint256 amount) public
```

#### Transfer Tokens

Transfer tokens to another address.

```solidity
function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool)
```

### Example

Here's how you might interact with the `MyToken` contract:

```javascript
const MyToken = artifacts.require("MyToken");

module.exports = async function(deployer, network, accounts) {
  await deployer.deploy(MyToken);
  const myTokenInstance = await MyToken.deployed();

  // Mint tokens
  await myTokenInstance.mint(1000, { from: accounts[0] });

  // Transfer tokens
  await myTokenInstance.transfer(accounts[1], 100, { from: accounts[0] });

  // Burn tokens
  await myTokenInstance.anyoneBurn(50, { from: accounts[1] });
};
```
