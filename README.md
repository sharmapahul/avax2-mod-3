# MyToken README

## Overview

MyToken is an ERC20-compliant token contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. This token includes additional functionalities such as burning tokens and minting new tokens, with ownership management for secure operations.

## Features

- **ERC20 Standard**: Implements the basic ERC20 functions.
- **Burnable Tokens**: Allows tokens to be burned (destroyed).
- **Mintable Tokens**: Allows new tokens to be minted by the owner.
- **Ownership Management**: Ownership functions are secured, with only the owner having permission to mint new tokens.

## Installation

To use or modify the MyToken contract, you'll need to have the following tools installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle)
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) (for local development)

### Step-by-Step Installation Guide

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/MyToken.git
    cd MyToken
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Compile the contract:**
    ```sh
    truffle compile
    ```

4. **Deploy the contract:**
    ```sh
    truffle migrate
    ```

## Usage

### Contract Deployment

The contract should be deployed with an initial owner address. Here's an example using Truffle migrations:

```javascript
const MyToken = artifacts.require("MyToken");

module.exports = function(deployer, network, accounts) {
  const initialOwner = accounts[0];  // Use the first account as the owner
  deployer.deploy(MyToken, initialOwner);
};
```

### Interacting with the Contract

You can interact with the deployed contract using Web3.js or any Ethereum wallet/browser extension such as MetaMask.

#### Minting Tokens

Only the owner of the contract can mint new tokens.

```javascript
const myToken = await MyToken.deployed();
await myToken.mint(web3.utils.toWei('100', 'ether'), { from: ownerAddress });
```

#### Transferring Tokens

Tokens can be transferred from one address to another.

```javascript
await myToken.TransferMale(recipientAddress, web3.utils.toWei('10', 'ether'), { from: senderAddress });
```

#### Burning Tokens

Anyone holding the tokens can burn them.

```javascript
await myToken.anyoneBurn(web3.utils.toWei('5', 'ether'), { from: holderAddress });
```
